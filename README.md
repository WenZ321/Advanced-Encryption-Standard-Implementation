# Advanced-Encryption-Standard-Implementation

This is my attempt on implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard for a 128 bit key. The inputs and outputs of my encrypt and decrypt files are length 16 strings. An explanation to AES is here in a paper I've written: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTvkVHpGI9wiYY3vJ9h1j1AFFp307Hnt/view?usp=sharing

There is also a testCases file if you implemented your own version and want to test it.
